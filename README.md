# DAPE Framework
DAPE (Domain Aligned Private Encoders) is a Framework for learning from multiple data-sources. Thereby, multiple encoders are jointly trained on data of different data-sources while using one common classifier. An MMD Loss is used for aligning the learnt representations of the encoders during train-time.

## Description
The DAPE Framework consists of mutliple encoders, one for each-data source. The encoder backbone can be chosen freely, it is also possible to use different encoders for different data-sources. The only constrain consists in the encoders outputs needing to have the same shape. The latent representations output by the encoders are used as input for a shared classifier, which makes predictions for each sample of each data-source. A visualization of the Framework is shown in the following figure. <br/><br/>![DAPE Framework](img/dape_framework.png).

## How to use it
In order to train the Framework, you can use the methods in `pipeline_funcs.py`, i.e. `train` and `test` to build yourself a custom pipeline. Else you can get a head start by using the method `pipeline` in the file `pipeline.py` to train and test a DAPE Framework. For more information on the methods parameters, please refer to the comments in the files.
